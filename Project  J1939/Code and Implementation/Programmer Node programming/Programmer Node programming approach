                                                                            PROGRAMMER NODE PROGRAMMING APPROACH
                                                                            ====================================

1.) Writing a firmware for blinking LED on specific GPIO Pin and Port.
2.) Implement the AES Encryption only functionality.
3.) Implement HMAC Hashing only functionality.
4.) J1939 CAN protocol for TX.


                                                                            How would we proceed ???
                                                                            ========================

First we'll write a simple testing firmware which we'll be flashing on receiver node over J1939 CAN protocol securely, the firmware will be then read in binary in programmer node's memory or will be 
placed in statically allocated array.
Once we've the firmware byte stream, we'll proceed to encrypt it using AES and then we'll calculate the HMAC hash of the entire byte stream and append it with the encrypted firmware data, key's for HMAC and 
AES will be pre-shared between both programmer and receiver node.
The entire data is now loaded into J1939 packets which will then perform data transmission frame by frame using CAN controller library.
