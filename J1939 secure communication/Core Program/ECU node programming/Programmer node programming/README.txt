:: Off node programming :
		Programming the power computer (x86/x86_64/ARM) for AES and HMAC security application on firmware and writing it in raw data chunks in sequence on SD card avoiding File system implementation and usage.
		This helps avoiding security implementation overhead from programmer node.

:: On node programming :
		Programming the programmer node from reading the data from SD card to sending it over the CAN network, implements methods for handling programmer node power failure providing resumed communication.
