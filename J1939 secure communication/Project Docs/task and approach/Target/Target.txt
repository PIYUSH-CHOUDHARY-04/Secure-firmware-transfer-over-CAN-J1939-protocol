	Project J1939 secure communications
	===================================

Task : Perform secure firmware transfer and firmware update over CAN-J1939 protocol, security refers to encrypting the firmware on sender side with AES256 and then calculating and appending its HMAC code to the encrypted firmware
       which in turn when received by receiver node, evaluated for integrity check via re-computation and comparing with received HMAC code, and at last performing firmware update.
